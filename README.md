Project Logo (Replace "link-to-logo.png" with the link to your project logo)

Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis experiment using Azimuth and GPT-4. The aim of this project is to automatically and accurately annotate cell types in scRNA-seq data without the need for manual curation. The experiment was inspired by the paper "Reference-free and cost-effective automated cell type annotation with GPT-4 in single-cell RNA-seq analysis" by Wenpin Hou and Zhicheng Ji.

Introduction
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity within complex tissues. However, cell type annotation in scRNA-seq analysis is a laborious and time-consuming process that often requires expert knowledge. This project explores the use of Azimuth, a package specialized for spatially resolved scRNA-seq data, and GPT-4, a powerful language model, to automatically and accurately annotate cell types.

Data
The scRNA-seq data used for this experiment was obtained from the 10x Genomics platform. The data is provided in the form of a Feature / barcode matrix HDF5 file (filtered) generated using the "spaceranger count" pipeline. It includes expression data from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) samples and uninvolved/normal samples, as well as cultured tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).

Methods
Data Preprocessing: The scRNA-seq data was preprocessed using the "spaceranger count" pipeline, which includes cell and gene filtering, normalization, and log transformation.

Spatial Analysis with Azimuth: The preprocessed data was analyzed using the Azimuth package to identify cell types and clusters in the spatially resolved data.

Cell Type Annotation with GPT-4: GPT-4, a highly potent language model, was used to automatically annotate cell types using marker gene information generated from the scRNA-seq data.

Results
The results of the cell type annotations generated by GPT-4 were compared to manual annotations, and the concordance between the two was evaluated. The performance of GPT-4 in identifying different cell types was assessed across multiple datasets and tissue types.

Dependencies
Azimuth (version X.X.X)
GPT-4 (version X.X.X)
Other dependencies (specify any other packages or tools used)
Usage
To replicate the experiment, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the required dependencies (e.g., Azimuth, GPT-4, and any other specified packages).

Preprocessing the scRNA-seq data will not be necessary if you decide to obtain data just as I did from 10X genomics. The  data sets are already preprocessed using the "spaceranger count" pipeline provided by 10x Genomics. However if you are obtaining your data from other sources 

Use Azimuth to perform spatial analysis on the preprocessed data and identify cell types and clusters.

Utilize GPT-4 to automatically annotate cell types based on the marker gene information.

Compare the GPT-4 annotations with manual annotations to evaluate the concordance.
